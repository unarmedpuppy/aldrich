# Managing Exterior Camera System

The exterior camera system uses [Blink](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5VLCL1N?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) camera + flood lights along with a [Blink Doorbell](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SGC46M9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)

Currently, the system requires a wifi connection provided by either tenant in order to function properly. (as of 7/2023 aldrich #1 tenants have the hub installed & connected to their wifi) We are looking into getting a dedicated connection for this amentity in the future.

In order to gain access to the camera set up on your device, you'll need to first download the [Blink app](https://blinkforhome.com/blink-app). Next, submit a maintenance request and request access to the Camera system. Provide the phone number you would like to have recieve the verification code that you will need to successfuly log in. Once you have a response to the maintenance request, use the credentials provided to log in. The verification code will be sent to the phone number you provided in the maintence request (there may be a small delay, if you have issues recieving the code you can schedule a time for setting up your device along with the maintenance request)

Once logged in to the blink app, you'll be able to view the live feed of the front doorbell along with the security cameras in the alley. The application is shared between both the upper & lower units, please do not alter the arming schedule or motion detection area of any of the devices since it will impact all users.
